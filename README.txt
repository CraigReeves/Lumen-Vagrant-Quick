This was tested and designed using Lumen 5.5.

The address you will put in your address bar is simply localhost.

1. Clone or download a new Lumen project from https://www.github.com/laravel/lumen

2. Take every one of the files in this repository EXCEPT for this README, .vagrant and .get and copy them into your Lumen's project's folder. 
Make sure they're in the project's main folder.

3. Run vagrant up in your command line and it should provision without any problems.

4. Migrate the database if you wish and you're all set!
